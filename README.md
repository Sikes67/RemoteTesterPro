# ⚡ Remote Tester Pro V4.6

A modern remote testing utility for Roblox exploiters.  
Built to scan, invoke, fire, and stress-test **RemoteEvents** and **RemoteFunctions** with a full GUI, popup messages, and smart safety checks.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Auto remote scanner (ReplicatedStorage, Workspace, etc)
- Invoke / Fire / Stress Test options
- Popup feedback system (success, warn, fail)
- Safe execution (pcall + timeout handling)
- Progress bar + fade-out finish text
- Lightweight draggable GUI
- Fail counter + retry system
- Updated design and performance boost (V4.6)

## 🧠 Why I Made This
I built this because I wanted something actually useful for the Roblox exploit community — not just another pasted remote viewer.  
It’s still in progress, but working solid so far.  
I’ll keep improving it and pushing updates while I’m on fall break — once school starts again, I’ll still drop patches and new features when I can.

## 🧭 Usage

2. Run it with your preferred executor
