🧩 Remote Tester Pro V4 — Patch Notes

@everyone @here

🛠️ Changes

Removed: “View Source” option — it provided no functional use and has been deprecated.

Improved: Fire and Invoke systems for better stability and responsiveness. These updates significantly reduce lag spikes and improve overall performance.

Added: Experimental Status Notifier that displays alerts when a remote call fails or is restricted to admin-only access.

🔮 Coming Soon
