⚡ Remote Tester Pro V4.7 - Patch Notes

🆕 New Features & Fixes:

Hybrid Remote Detection:

Added a listening system that detects newly added RemoteEvent and RemoteFunction instances automatically.

Ensures no remotes are missed, even if created after the script starts.

Optimized to prevent lag by avoiding constant rescans.


Caching & Performance:

Newly added remotes are cached to prevent duplicate UI elements.

Reduces unnecessary processing while keeping detection accurate.

--------------------------------------


⚡ Remote Tester Pro V4.6 – Patch Notes

ADDED / IMPROVED:

✅ Optimized stress/hammer test with proper ✅ success / ❌ fail counting and fade-out finish.

⚠️ Now accurately counts fails for unresponsive, blocked, or unhammerable remotes.

🛡 Checks for unsafe remotes and shows warnings when stress test attempts fail.

🔍 Improved search filter and automatic remote scanning.

🛠 Safe error handling for FireServer and InvokeServer.

🖥 GUI enhancements: draggable window and proper layout.


Stress Test Behavior Improvements:

1. Fail counter added for unresponsive remotes:

RemoteFunction: InvokeServer wrapped in pcall with error detection. Timeout or error counts as fail.

RemoteEvent: FireServer wrapped in pcall. Fail counted if repeated fires do not succeed or throw errors.
